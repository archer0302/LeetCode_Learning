# Array and String

## Introduction to Array

### Array

- basic data structure to store a collection of elements sequentially
- can be accessed randomly since each element can be identified by a array index

### One-dimensional array (linear array)

```
A =   {6, 3, 8, 7, 2, 9}
index  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Length of A = 6
A[0] = 6
A[1] = 3
...
```

## Introduction to Dynamic Array

- Array has a fixed capacity
- Dynamic array has variable size
  - Examples: vector in C++, ArrayList in Java
